      <description>Bob I&amp;rsquo;m Marcus (bob for short) and I&amp;rsquo;m an Automation Engineer at a Financial Institution in South Africa. I&amp;rsquo;ve previously worked at the Ovations Group and Barclays Bank PLC.
I currently work in an operational team that is tasked with automating builds and deployments as well as building tooling to try make the lives of others interacting with infrastructure easier. As part of this team, we run various tools (chef, gitlab, rocketchat), we&amp;rsquo;ve built and support hosting platforms (openstack, kubernetes) and provide support/coaching/training for other members of the organisation.</description>

      <description>Welcome to operationaldev.com! For the longest time I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to create a blog but in the words of Top Gear, I&amp;rsquo;ve been ambitious but rubbish. Hopefully this attempt will go better. Also this time I&amp;rsquo;ve got a little help from Steve.
By day, I’m an engineer tasked with automating infrastructure builds and deployments as well as building tooling to the lives of others easier. By night, I’m an engineer trying to learn more about automating and building stuff.</description>

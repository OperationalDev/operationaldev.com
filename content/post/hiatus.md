Soooooo doing the blog thing might not have gone as well as planned. 2018
kinda got away from me. Work got really intensive and then turned to utter
shit. I decided it was time for a change and got a new job in August 2018. It's
take a little while to get going again, but this year you can expect at least
5 potst!

Welcome to operationaldev.com! For the longest time I've wanted to create a blog but in the words of Top Gear, I've been ambitious but rubbish. Hopefully this attempt will go better. Also this time I've got a little help from Steve.

By day, I’m an engineer tasked with automating infrastructure builds and deployments as well as building tooling to the lives of others easier. By night, I’m an engineer trying to learn more about automating and building stuff.

Along with the tooling and platforms I've built and run, I’ve also written a bunch of chef cookbooks (Ed: written: 50+, published/open sourced: 0) and a few terraform modules which I will hopefully be open sourcing and making available for others to use and learn from.

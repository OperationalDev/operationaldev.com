Welcome to operationaldev.com! For the longest time I've wanted to create a blog but in the words of Top Gear, I've been ambitious but rubbish. Hopefully this attempt will go better. Also this time I've got a little help from my good friend Steve.

By day, I'm an engineer tasked with automating infrastructure builds and deployments as well as building tooling to make the lives of others easier (Ed: And sharing your winning personality of course). By night, I'm an engineer trying to learn more about automating and building stuff. Kinda lucky in that sense that my day job is also something I really enjoy doing.

Every so often, we will be posting about various technologies we use and how we use them. These will range from Config Management/Infrastructure tools like Chef and Terraform to hosting platforms like Kubernetes and Openstack.

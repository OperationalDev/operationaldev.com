Automation Engineer more on the Ops side of things that enjoys solving infrastructure deployment problems with Infrastructure as Code and pudding cups. He knows lots about Chef, Openstack and Infrastructure in general and a little bit about everything else. Will do any form of automation for a free T-shirt.

Automation Engineer more on the Dev side of things (Ed: but surprisingly knows lots of infrastructure stuff too). Master of all programming languages that require indentation or that don't start with the letters PHP. Also cannot contain himself when it comes to kubernetes and has been known to run a k8s environment that works for everything that isn't Microsoft SQL Server
